# Hydro Pi-nics
The project merges technology and farming together through the utilization of IoT devices to track the pH level, nutrient level, and water level of the hydroponic system.

## Why?
 There is food insecurity and a declining area of farmable land in the US. The project is an answer to sustainable farming using hydroponic growing. 

## Features/Objectives
* The guides from last year will be used to rebuild the system
* There will be some overall upgrades to the system. This includes:
    * Improved Lighting
    * Webcam Integration 
    * Mycodo Integration
    * Integrated Lights & Pump
    * Basin & Sensor Rebuild
* The system can undergo some general quality of life (QOL) upgrades to make the system more functional in the long run.
    * Seeding Growing Area
    * Increased Growing Capacity
    * Successive Harvesting
* The data obtained can be logged in a more efficient manner.
* The overall network can be monitored and better secured. 

## Constraints
* Funding can be an issue for this project. Though I have been given the hardware from the previous year, I would still like to upgrade some aspects of the system - which can get expensive.
* Space. I need to keep the system and the items used confined in a small area, and I might need to move the system to a different area.
* If the system is moved to a different area, I would need a subnet in the Champlain network, or my own network at the Leahy Center.
* I am completely unfamiliar with Arduino programming, so the Mycodo integration can be an issue.
