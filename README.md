## Topic Ideas
This represents my topic ideas for week one of the Fall 2022 semester. 

### Hydro Pi-nics Continuation
Originally created by Connor Merchant and Sam Johnson, the project is an answer to sustainable farming using hydroponic growing. The project merges technology and farming together through the utilization of IoT devices to track the pH level, nutrient level, and water level of the hydroponic system. 
#### Problem
Food insecurity, declining area of farmable land. 
#### Plan
Since this is a project that Champlain College is interested in, it can be expanded upon and improved with some additional ideas. Including, but not limited to: automation, increased growing capacity, mycodo integration, webcam integration, long term data longing, and network monitoring. If it is of interest to get the community involved, the project could have high school interns learning how to monitor the logs that the system records, through the natural behavior or physical manipulation of the sensors. 

### Apple AirTag Vulnerability
There have been cases where people have been kidnapped where the attacker used Apple AirTags as their main recon device. Attackers have put AirTags on victims’ cars and tracked their location to pinpoint their target. What are the vulnerabilities that Apple AirTags have, and how can they be exploited? Is there a way to improve the safety of the devices?
#### Problem
Unwanted tracking and stalking. 
#### Plan
1. Look into the security of Apple AirTags,and how a person can exploit them for malicious purposes. 
1. Physically test the “tracking” of an individual by putting the AirTag into my personal car or a friend’s (with consent of course).
1. Research into the range that an AirTag will track for. Can you only find your tag when a few feet away from it? Miles? Countries?
1. It might be beneficial to not only look into AirTags, but other “tags” as well. Including: TilePro, Cube GPS Tracker, or the Samsung Galaxy SmartTag.

### Social Media Vulnerability & Pentesting
Are there any current vulnerabilities on social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter? What are their Terms of Service on user privacy, and what are their requirements for passwords? Test various password strengths and see how easily accounts can be exploited. 
#### Problem
Personal privacy and security on the internet.
#### Plan
1. Research and learn about various social media platforms’ Terms of Service.
1. Look into recent vulnerabilities regarding social media accounts, and how malicious actors have exploited them. 
1. Test the password requirements for different platforms in varying degrees of strength. Integrate a password manager. What password leaves your account with the most security? Which password is the most exploitable?

### Scout Cybersecurity Badge
Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts (now just Scouts) offer badges for individuals to obtain on the overarching topic of cybersecurity. Many troops don’t have the funds to really delve into the topic, or have someone to properly guide the scouts through the badge. 
#### Problem
Lack of cybersecurity education in traditional classrooms. 
#### Plan
1. Work with Girl Scout and Scout Troops in the area to help them earn their tech/cybersecurity badges. 
1. Create material around the requirements for the badges. 
1. Teach troops about cybersecurity.
