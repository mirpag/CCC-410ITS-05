## Topic Ideas
This represents my topic ideas for week one of the Fall 2022 semester. 

### Hydro Pi-nics Continuation
Originally created by Connor Merchant and Sam Johnson, the project is an answer to sustainable farming using hydroponic growing. The project merges technology and farming together through the utilization of IoT devices to track the pH level, nutrient level, and water level of the hydroponic system. Since this is a project that Champlain College is interested in, it can be expanded upon and improved with some additional ideas. Including, but not limited to: automation, increased growing capacity, mycodo integration, webcam integration, long term data longing, and network monitoring. If it is of interest to get the community involved, the project could have high school interns learning how to monitor the logs that the system records, through the natural behavior or physical manipulation of the sensors. 

### Apple AirTag Vulnerability
There have been cases where people have been kidnapped where the attacker used Apple AirTags as their main recon device. Attackers have put AirTags on victimsâ€™ cars and tracked their location to pinpoint their target. What are the vulnerabilities that Apple AirTags have, and how can they be exploited? Is there a way to improve the safety of the devices?

### Social Media Vulnerability & Pentesting
Are there any current vulnerabilities on social media sites such as Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter? What are their Terms of Service on user privacy, and what are their requirements for passwords? Test various password strengths and see how easily accounts can be exploited. 

### Scout Cybersecurity Badge
Work with Girl Scout and Scout Troops in the area to help them earn their tech/cybersecurity badges. Create material around the requirements for the badges.
